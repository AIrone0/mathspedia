mathspedia aims to be a reference website like wikipedia for mathematics
the issues with wikipedia is its a global and cannot be tailored to the specific needs of mathematics:

6. needs History (its motivation and the history of how it came be) like Parrot's theorem
7. graph like visual? like augusti
