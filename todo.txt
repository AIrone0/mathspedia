Now for AI 
deploy with dns, vps and setup github actions 
check if ranking mechanism, ab testing, ways of adding custom maths (image, latex, manim, animations, iframes ) work
add theorems from
stoch calc
jim ha,
proofs and 
primes, 
math for ML, 
Parrot's theorem
check how wikipedia and OS projects have rules of organization like or theorem have history.. ludwig, and who is authorized to write
add AI-assisted videos, images and animations.

clean current slope code
have a US graphic company design and font
add faq
setup more settings
learn for better algorithms for AB testing and rank of writers.
AI format references
login and verification with email or name mathstodon for rank 




Mathspedia aims to be a reference website like wikipedia for mathematics ('s theorems first)
the issues with wikipedia is its a global and cannot be tailored to the specific needs of mathematics:
1. circular explanation, no incitation to distill the knowledge => clear explanations? learn and write how to edit
2. math "qualified" people are often wrongly corrected for more nuanced answer (whatever that means) => rank based on math qualification and ab approv
3. issue with copyright when uploading image. => AI for text to math image/videos/animations
4. lack of intuitive videos and interactive animations. => AI make it simple to add them + embed great ressources.
5. lack of updating references as math is an evolving fields. => AI manage ressources link and reporting one source as outdated/false include error messages on all articles
6. needs History (its motivation and the history of how it came be) like Parrot's theorem => write in the how to edit file
7. graph like visual? like augusti => for now do like obsidian map but wait to see if Augusti cooked.
tree of prerequisites and history.
