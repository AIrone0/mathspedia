With a **prime factorization** $n = p_1 \\ldots p_n$, we understand the prime factors $p_j$ of $n$ to be ordered as $p_i \\leq p_{i+1}$. The **fundamental theorem of arithmetic** is:\n\n$$\\textbf{Theorem: } \\text{Every } n \\in \\mathbb{N}, n > 1 \\text{ has a unique prime factorization.}$$\nEuclid anticipated the result. **Carl Friedrich Gauss** gave in *1798* the first proof in his monograph *\"Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\"*. Within abstract algebra, the result is the statement that the ring of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ is a **unique factorization domain**.",
